"""
A strong number is a number whose sum of the factorial of digits is equal to the original number.
E.g. 145 is strong number because 1! + 4! + 5! = 145. 
That is: (1*1) + (4*3*2*1) + (5*4*3*2*1) = 145
Write a program that allows the user to enter an integer. The program outputs whether the number is strong or not and ensures that an arithmetic overflow cannot crash the program.
