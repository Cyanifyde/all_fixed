"""
Write a program that allows the user to store up to 10 notes.  The program should have this functionality on an infinite loop:
Output all the notes stored, numbered 0-9.
Ask the user to enter a number for a note to change.
Ask the user to enter the new note.
Over-write any existing note stored at that position.
