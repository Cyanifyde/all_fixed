""""
Write a subroutine that will output the raw cost of energy usage by taking three parameters: previous meter reading, current reading and calorific value.
The units used equals the current reading minus the previous reading.
kWh = units used * 1.022 * calorific value divided by 3.6.
The calorific value varies a little by each supplier, are governed by legislation and provided by the National Grid. Assume a value of 39.3.
Energy is charged at 2.84p per kWh.
You do not need to format the output because the result is the input to further calculations.
