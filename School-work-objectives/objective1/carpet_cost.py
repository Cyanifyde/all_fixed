Write a subroutine that outputs the cost of fitting a carpet using 3 parameters:
Width of the room in metres.
Length of the room in metres.
Price of carpet per m2.
Underlay for the carpet will also be required at £3 per m2.
Grippers will be required at £1/m: width * 2 + length * 2
The fitting fee is £50.
Test the program with a 7 x 6m room and a £17m2 carpet.
E.g. 7m x 6m room with a £17 carpet = £714 + £126 + £26 + £50 = £916

x = int(input("please input length\n"))

z = int(input("please input cost per m^2\n"))


def calculate(x, y, z):
    under = z * 3
    greppers = (x * 2 + y * 2)
    carpet = x * y * z
    return (under + greppers + carpet + 50)
